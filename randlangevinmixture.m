function Z = randlangevinmixture(n, kappa1, kappa2, p)
% Generate random rotations with mixed Langevin distributions.
%
% kappa1, kappa2 and p are vectors of same length N.
% Entries in kappa1 and kappa2 are nonnegative.
% Entries in p lie between 0 and 1.
%
% Z is an nxnxN matrix such that each slice Z(:, :, i) is a rotation matrix
% sampled with probability p(i) from a Langevin with concentration
% kappa1(i) and with probability p(i) from a Langevin with concentration
% kappa2(i). The Langevin's are isotropic with mean at the identity.
