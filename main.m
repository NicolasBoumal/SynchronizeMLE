% Synchronize N rotations in SO(n). Rtrue contains the true rotations we
% are looking for. Of course, these are not known for a real problem
% instance.
n = 3;
N = 100;
Rtrue = randrot(n, N);

% Rotations with indices in A are anchored. Ra contains the rotations of
% these anchors. That is: Ra(:, :, k) contains the nxn rotation matrix
% associated to the node A(k), which is anchored. If there are no anchors,
% simply let A = [1] and Ra = eye(n), that is: artificially fix any of the
% rotations to an arbitrary value.
m = 1;
A = 1:m;
Ra = Rtrue(:, :, A);

% Create a representation of the manifold P_A: a product of rotation groups
% with the nodes indexed by A (the anchors) fixed to their known value.
manifold = anchoredrotationsfactory(n, N, A, Ra);

% For this test problem instance, we generate a random Erdos-Renyi graph.
% For each edge in the graph, we will have a measurement of the relative
% rotation between the adjacent nodes. The data is presented this way:
% I, J are two column vectors of length M, where M is the number of edges.
% There is an edge between nodes I(k) and J(k) for k = 1 : M.
% The graph is symmetric, so that we only define each edge once. That is:
% if the matrix [I J] contains the row [a b], then it does not contain the
% row [b a]. ERp is the edge density in the Erdos-Renyi graph.
% For a complete graph, you may use: [I J] = find(triu(ones(N), 1));
ERp = 0.75;
[I, J] = erdosrenyi(N, ERp);
M = length(I);

% Pick noise parameters (see the mixture of Langevin distribution described
% in our CDC paper) and generate noise (random rotation matrices) according
% to these parameters. The measurements are stored in H, a 3D matrix such
% that each slice H(:, :, k) is an nxn rotation matrix which corresponds to
% a measurement of the relative rotation Ri Rj^T,
% with Ri = Rtrue(:, :, I(k)) and Rj = Rtrue(:, :, J(k)).
% The measurement H(:, :, k) is distributed around the real relative
% rotation with parameters kappa1(k), kappa2(k) and p(k), where kappa1,
% kappa2 and p are vectors of length M.
% Of course, for a real problem instance, you just need to obtain H from
% your data directly.
kappa1 = 8.0*ones(M, 1);
kappa2 = 0.0*ones(M, 1);
p = 0.70*ones(M, 1);
Z = randlangevinmixture(n, kappa1, kappa2, p);
Htrue = multiprod(Rtrue(:, :, I), multitransp(Rtrue(:, :, J)));
H = multiprod(Z, Htrue);

% Put all the data together in a structure which describes the
% synchronization problem. Here, kappa1, kappa2 and p need not be the same
% as those used in generating the measurements. In fact, for real
% applications, the true values for these noise parameters are unknown. You
% must then guess these parameters, based on prior information you have
% about the measurements (how accurate you think they are, how many
% outliers you expect there to be). If you are not sure, set them to a
% reasonable value and use MLE+: our MLE algorithm which will iteratively
% estimate the rotations then the noise parameters, then the rotations,
% etc. For MLE+, kappa1, kappa2 and p need to be constant vectors.
% Otherwise, only their average is taken into account. If you really don't
% know, try with kappa1 = 10, kappa2 = 0 and p = 0.9. This means you expect
% 10% of outliers and 90% of measurements with roughly 20 degrees errors.
synchroproblem = buildproblem(n, N, M, I, J, H, kappa1, kappa2, p, A, Ra);

% synchronization. It's a bit different from synchronizeEIG, in that it
% takes anchors into account.

% In real applications, chances are you don't know the parameters kappa1,

% alternatively estimates the rotations and the noise parameters,
% iteratively. See Nicolas Boumal's thesis for details.
% It will use the mean values of kappa1, kappa2 and p given in the
% synchroproblem structure as initial guess for these parameters. All
% measurements are assumed to have the same noise distribution (i.i.d.).
% In this test file, the true parameters are used as initial guess, which
% is not very impressive of course. With real data for which the noise
% distribution is unknown, this algorithm should prove more interesting.
