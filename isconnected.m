% FUNCTION ISCONN = ISCONNECTED(N, I, J)
%
% Given a list of edges (I(k) <-> J(k)) in an undirected graph with N nodes
% numbered from 1 to N, this function returns true if the graph is
% connected, and false otherwise.
%
% This function does not check whether edges are specified only once or
% not. In particular, you should make sure that if the edge (i, j) is
% specified, the edge (j, i) does not appear in the edges list.
%
% TODO: This algorithm uses the Laplacian of the graph, but really, we
%       should just do a flood filling...

    % The graph is connected if the multiplicity of the 0 eigenvalue of L
    % is one, or, equivalently, if the matrix L from which we deleted any
    % one row and column is full rank. For sparse matrices, this can be
    % checked by making sure that the smallest eigenvalue of such a matrix
    % is not 'too close to zero'.

    % fast)
