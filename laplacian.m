% L = laplacian(N, I, J, w)

% L is the un-normalized Laplacian of the N-nodes undirected graph
% described by the edges I(k)<->J(k). L is a sparse matrix.
%
% w is the weight vector such that edge (I(k), J(k)) has weight w(k). If w
% is not specified, all edges have weight 1. If w is a scalar, all edges
% have weight w.
