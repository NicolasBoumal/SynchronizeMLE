% Cramér-Rao bounds for synchronization of rotations,
% in Information and Inference, a journal of the IMA, 2013.
%
% C is of size NxN and is such that C(i, i) is a lower bound on the
% expected squared distance between rotation i and the estimator of
% rotation i. This is valid for anchored synchronization. For anchor-free
% synchronization or 1-anchor synchronization,
% C(i, i) + C(j, j) - 2*C(i, j) is approximately a lower bound on the
% expected squared distance between the relative rotation Ri*Rj^T and the
% estimator of that relative rotation.
%
% This code for the CRB assumes the measurement graph is connected. If the
% graph is not connected (or not numerically connected in case of very
% small weights), the behaviour of this function is undefined. Most likely,
% there will be an error or a warning when calling the 'inv' function.
%
% For SO(2), there are no curvature terms in the CRB.
% For SO(3), the curvature terms are included in the CRB.
% For SO(n), n >= 4, the curvature terms are neglected in the CRB.
%
% msecrb is the CRB on the mean squared error (MSE), normalized by the
% number of rotations to estimate. If there are no anchors, the number of
% "free" rotations is N-1 and not N, because of the global rotation
% ambiguity.

    % information quality.
    L = synchrolaplacian(problem);
    
    % If this is anchor-free syncrhonization
    if isempty(A)    
        % The CRB is essentially the pseudoinverse of L.
        % It can be computed generically as follows:
        % iLA = pinv(full(L));
        % This is rather slow. A faster way for anchor-free synchronization,
        % following a suggestion by Kunal Chaudhury, is to leverage the
        % fact that we know the null space of L: it is spanned by the vector
        % of all ones (this is since we assume the graph is connected).
        % Hence, by shifting the Laplacian along the null space direction,
        % we make it invertible; calling inv is much faster than calling
        % pinv. Then, simply remove the null space component.
        iLA = inv(full(L) + ones(N)/N) - ones(N)/N;
        % If you have a disconnected measurement graph but you are aware of
        % it and know how to interpret the CRB then (see the paper), then
        % it is better to call pinv: that is the correct formulation for
        % the CRB when the graph is disconnected.
        
    % If this is anchored synchronization
    else
        % Similarly here, we could simply build the masked Laplacian LA by
        % forcing rows and columns corresponding to anchors to zero:
        % LA = L;
        % LA(:, A) = 0;
        % LA(A, :) = 0;
        % iLA = pinv(full(LA));
        % This code also works for anchor-free synchronozation by the way,
        % but this is rather slow again. Instead, we know that this will
        % give the same result as if we invert the non-masked entries of LA:
        notA = setdiff(1:N, A);
        iLA = zeros(size(L));
        iLA(notA, notA) = inv(full(L(notA, notA)));

    % expression. For n >= 4, we have no expression (but the curvature
    % terms in the CRB should be negligible).
