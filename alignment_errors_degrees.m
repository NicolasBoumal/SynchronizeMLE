function errs = alignment_errors_degrees(Rtrue, Rhat, Q)
% Given reference rotations, other rotations and an alignment matrix (best
% obtained from soregister(Rtrue, Rhat)), returns a vector with as many
% numbers as there are rotations, each one indicating in degrees the
% distance between the reference and the other rotation aligned by Q.
