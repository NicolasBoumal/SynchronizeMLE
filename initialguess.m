function R0 = initialguess(problem)
% Computes an initial guess for a synchronization of rotations problem,
% based on the eigenvector method (synchronizeEIG). This function
% additionally takes anchors into account.
%
% The output R is a nxnxN matrix containing the estimated rotations.

    % Obtain anchor information: A is the index list and Ra contains the
    % rotations associated to the anchors. Ra has size nxnxm, where is the
    % length of A, i.e., the number of anchors.
    A = problem.A;
    Ra = problem.Ra;
    
    % The EIG method does not take anchors into account.
    Reig = synchronizeEIG(problem);
    
    % Now align the EIG estimator with the anchors as well as possible,
    % then force the anchors.

    R0 = multiprod(Reig, Q);
