% [cost store] = funcost(problem, R, store)
%
%  The store structure is as described in the documentation of Manopt: it
%  is a structure used as caching mechanism, such that each time a
%  cost-related function is called at R (be it the cost, the gradient or
%  the Hessian), the associated store structure is passed along. This makes
%  it possible to cut down on redundant computations.
